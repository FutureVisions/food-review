Food Project. 
In this project users can create their own accounts and post whatever food they want to upload. Once uploaded all the food that has been uploaded will show in the dashboard where the images are clickable and takes you to their respective pages where users can like the food or comment on it. Users can also click on their own accounts to see their profiles and upload food images from their profile page.
